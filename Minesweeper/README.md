Completed Minesweeper, has some minor bugs and it's totally not easily won if you know simple javascript (or how to open inspect element, F12), but it works, plus who would cheat themselves in a single player game. PS don't resize as 400 divs do take their toll on the browser.. You've been warned.

This was a project of mine to make a simplistic/modern minesweeper while at work! This was all done on github it self thus the reason of so many commits, and it was very tedious.

it took me a total of 3 shifts (3*6, 18 hours) to complete, it's not perfect and i would like to fix some stuff, but I didn't aim for perfection I really just wanted
something to do.

Thanks for viewing my project!
